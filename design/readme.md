If **cloud landing zones** are analogous to **airports**, the OCI Open LZ [Blueprint](#) is a highly secure and scalable airport with the possibility of having different terminals (OEs), that can be &ndash; but don't have to be &ndash; operated independently by different companies/subsidiaries. Each terminal can have a different security posture (domestic, international, etc.), teams, and resources, and communication between those terminals, inside or outside the airport, is possible, automated, and secured. 

&nbsp; 

## **2. Design View**

The Security, Network, and Operations design are presented in a [PDF](/design/OCI_Open_LZ.pdf) format and supported by a [Drawio](/design/OCI_Open_LZ.drawio) containing all design diagrams, for reuse while tailoring your landing zones.

&nbsp; 

## **3. Runtime View**
The Runtime View is presented in the form of   [runnable operations with IaC configurations](/examples/oci-open-lz/readme.md).
