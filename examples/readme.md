Welcome to the **OCI Open LZ Catalogue**. 

The OCI Open LZ is much more than a blueprint, is a set of artifacts that can reduce your efforts in any OCI design and OCI running activities. It provides best practices with design blueprints, landing zone exercises, and runnable IaC configurations to provision or change OCI resources. 

&nbsp; 

## 1. Learning Landing Zones

If you're starting on landing zone design and/or IaC configurations, this is your section.


&nbsp; 

| NAME | OBJECTIVE  | ASSETS |
|---|---|---|
| OCI Learn LZ | An Application Domain-Driven Landing Zone to organize enterprise resources. | [Overview](/examples/oci-learn-lz/readme.md) </br> [Draw.io](/examples/oci-learn-lz/OCI_Learn_LZ.drawio) 
| OCI Learn LZ | Exercise #1  - Design and configure the OCI Learn LZ Tenancy Structure | [Exercise](/examples/oci-learn-lz/exercise1/readme.md) </br> [IaC Config](/examples/oci-learn-lz/exercise1/config_yaml/oci_learn_lz_iam_final.yml)
| OCI Learn LZ | Exercise #2  - Design and configure the OCI Learn LZ Network Structure | [Exercise](/examples/oci-learn-lz/exercise2/readme.md) </br> [IaC Config](/examples/oci-learn-lz/exercise2/config_yaml/oci_learn_lz_network_final.yml)


&nbsp; 

## 2. Blueprint Landing Zones

The blueprints help solve specific and complex OCI landing and operation requirements - when you're [tailoring a landing zone](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/landing-zones/tailored_landing_zones/tailored_landing_zones.md). These elements have complete OCI SecNetOps designs and OCI runtime with IaC configuration. They are used to scale/bridge with existing operating models, complying with fine-grained segregations of duties, strong network isolation, and heterogeneous workloads.


&nbsp; 

| NAME | OBJECTIVE  | DESIGN | RUNTIME | 
|---|---|---|---|
| OCI Open LZ | Onboard operating entities in form of organizations, line of businesses or subsidiaries into OCI. | [View PDF](/design/OCI_Open_LZ.pdf) </br >[View Drawio](/design/OCI_Open_LZ.drawio)| [View](/examples/oci-open-lz/readme.md) |



&nbsp; 

## 3. Workloads Landing Zones

&nbsp; 

A set of landing zones ready for specific workloads. Each flavor has a design with IaC configurations ready to be deployed. We'll add more elements soon.

&nbsp; 

| NAME | OBJECTIVE  | DESIGN | RUNTIME | 
|---|---|---|---|
| OCI Open EBS LZ | A ready-made landing zone for EBS with a complete design and IaC runtime. | [View](/examples/oci-ebs-lz/readme.md) | [View](/examples/oci-ebs-lz/op02-deploy-Open-EBS-pattern/readme.md) |
